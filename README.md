This is the repository for our TCSS 360 group project: Cool Trivia Maze!

This game is similar to a typical maze, in that you must navigate through tile-shaped passages to reach an exit. 
The difference here is that to unlock passages (or "doors") between tiles (or "rooms"), you must correctly answer a trivia question in order to open the door. 

If you answer the question incorrectly, the door will shut and you can no longer attempt to open it, but other viable routes will be available unless you cannot answer any of them. 
Trivia questions are randomly selected from a local database, primarily consisting of jokes, memes, and pop culture references. 

For clarification, our source file solution containing the project is our cool trivia maze directory.

Our unit tests can be found in the __tests directory__ within the source file solution (cool trivia maze directory).
All of our code for the game can be found in the __scripts directory__ within the source file solution (cool trivia maze directory) as well.

You can install the game by going to the __installer/artifacts directory__. From there, you should see the CoolTriviaMaze_Setup.exe file. 
Once you run the file, follow its steps and the game should be installed in your device!

Our documentation files are placed in our __Deliverables directory__, which include the following:
