Repository for our TCSS 360 group project: Cool Trivia Maze!

This game is similar to a typical maze, in that you must navigate through tile-shaped passages to reach an exit. 
The difference here is that to unlock passages (or "doors") between tiles (or "rooms"), you must correctly answer a trivia question in order to open the door. 
If you answer the question incorrectly, the door will shut and you can no longer attempt to open it, but other viable routes will be available unless you cannot answer any of them. 
Trivia questions are randomly selected from a local database, primarily consisting of jokes, memes, and pop culture references.
